# Hi There! My name is Ekansh Kothiyal 🤠 
### *or popularly known as chunkybyte by my mom and 2 of my good friends*

I am currently working as a **Senior UI Developer at Media.Net**, the second largest contextual advertising network in the world 🔠

## My stack

Well I don't know a lot but for starters:
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript
* ES6
* jQuery, ReactJS
* Task Runner - Gulp
* PHP (Beginner)
* Wordpress

## Something non-DEV about me
#### Like how it would have been on Tinder like application -

I have a deadpan sense of humor and I look up to people like [Taika Waititi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taika_Waititi), [Rick Sanchez C-137](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Rick_Sanchez), [Naval Ravikant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Ravikant). 

I like to read and re-read, watch and re-watch and then re-watch comedies (especially the quirky ones motivated by nihilism as core - hence the *Rick Sanchez* if you know the show R&M). 
Also I publicly and annoyingly advocate against social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram more specifically). You can read my non-structured rants [here on Medium](https://medium.com/@ekothiyal/permanently-deleted-my-moderately-active-instagram-account-6e1afb887cad). Also I am very impulsive and mostly work on animal like instincts than a logical brain. 

Heres an anecdote - It was 3.30am after a long day and I went to prepare a cup of chai tea for myself. The milk had gone bad and I had a terrible headache, so I stayed up for 2 more hours with a headache to create a [parody portfolio for myself](https://bored-chunkybyte.netlify.app/). Yeah no one gets why I like telling it so much.

## Wanna make "Fraaandships" with me?

That's enough about me though - you want to talk? You can reach out to me on my twitter (I know I know social media) -

* For a DEV persona: [@devchunkybyte](https://twitter.com/devchunkybyte) 🧜‍♂️
