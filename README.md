# Ekansh Kothiyal (UI Developer/Blogger)

I am currently working as a **Senior UI Developer at Anatta.io** ðŸ” 

My former organizations include Media.net and Publicis Sapient with clients spanning across content, finance and e-commerce domains. My notable projects have been working on DollarShaveClub, Forbes Advisor, and Altria.

My tech stack includes the common tools like HTML(5)/CSS(3) and JavaScript(ES6) and TypeScript.
I have experience with working on ReactJS (primarily v16) and VueJS (v3) and jQuery (oh well).

I also delved in a bit of a backend work writing PHP on WordPress applications.

I also write blog posts - technical and non-technical. I have been told I write fairly well for an ogre. You can check them out on [Medium](https://chunkybyte.medium.com/) or [Hashnode](https://blog.chunkybyte.xyz/).

## Like to talk?

I am social psychology buff. I love to talk about anything under and around and beyond the sun.

You can reach out to me on my twitter [@devchunkybyte](https://twitter.com/devchunkybyte) or on linkedIn [@ekanshkothiyal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ekanshkothiyal/).
