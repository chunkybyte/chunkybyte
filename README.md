Hi! My name is Ekansh Kothiyal.

I am currently working as a Senior UI Developer at Media.Net.

I like to read, watch and re-watch and then re-watch comedies (especially the quirky ones motivated by nihilism as core).

I love to talk to people... a lot. That always hinders my work because I'll skip working on anything when I start talking and a call duration of 2 hours is my average.

That's enough about me - reach out to talk on my twitter @devchunkybyte.
