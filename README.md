# Hi! My name is 𝙴𝚔𝚊𝚗𝚜𝚑 𝙺𝚘𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚢𝚊𝚕,🇮🇳 🤠 
## or popularly known as chunkybyte by my mom and 2 of my good friends

I am currently working as a **Senior UI Developer at Media.Net**, the second largest contextual advertising network in the world 🔠

## My "Stack"

Well I don't know a lot but for starters:
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript
* ES6
* jQuery, ReactJS
* Task Runner - Gulp
* PHP (Beginner)
* Wordpress

## Something non-DEV about me
### Like how it would have been on Tinder like application

I have a deadpan sense of humor and I look up to people like Taika Waititi, Rick Sanchez, Naval Raviknat. I like to read and re-read, watch and re-watch and then re-watch comedies (especially the quirky ones motivated by nihilism as core - hence the Rick Sanchez). Also I advocate against social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram more specifically). You can read my non-structured rants [here on Medium](https://medium.com/@ekothiyal/permanently-deleted-my-moderately-active-instagram-account-6e1afb887cad). Also I am [very impulsive](https://bored-chunkybyte.netlify.app/).

## Wanna make "Fraaandships" with me?

That's enough about me though - you want to talk? You can reach out to me on my twitter (I know I know social media) - 
* For my philospher and general optimistic nihilist persona: [@thelilwannabe](https://twitter.com/thelilwannabe).
* For a DEV persona: [@devchunkybyte](https://twitter.com/devchunkybyte).

If you want to see me in a more "professional" capacity, you can DM me on [LinkedIn: @ekanshkothiyal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ekanshkothiyal/).
And for wathcing me trying too hard to be noticed in the DEV community, you can always look at my sad [DEV: @chunkybyte](https://dev.to/chunkybyte) profile.
